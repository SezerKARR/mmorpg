In this 2D game clone of Metin2, I focused on applying SOLID principles and exploring the use of programming patterns to create a maintainable and scalable architecture.I also experimented with storing data using ScriptableObjects, which provided a structured and efficient way to manage game-related information. This approach allowed me to separate logic from data, improve reusability, and make the project more modular. Additionally, I emphasized clean code practices to ensure the project remains flexible for future updates and enhancements
